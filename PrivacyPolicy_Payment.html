<p>This document describes how we treat personal information when you use Levanto Financial Inc.’s products and services on its website and related websites.</p>

<h1>OUR COMPANY</h1>

<p>Levanto Financial Inc. (“Levanto”) operates a personal financial management service and technology platform at www.levantofinancial.com. The Levanto website and all content available thereon are collectively referred to herein as the “Site”. This Privacy Policy describes how Levanto treats personal information when you use the Site and services, including information you provide to us as a user (“User”). Additional rules may apply to you, as described in this Privacy Policy, if you are a User who is also a client of Levanto (“Client”).
</p>

<h1>CONFIDENTIALITY</h1>

<article><p>As a User and Client of Levanto, you may exchange communication with Levanto through means that are not inherently secure, including, but not limited to, e-mail, phone, fax, and online chat. Any and all communication between you and Levanto such as emails and any attachments to them (the "Communication") is confidential and is for the use only of the intended recipient. The Communication may contain copyright material of Levanto Financial, or any of its related entities or third parties. If a recipient is not the intended recipient of the Communication, please notify the sender immediately by return email, delete the Communication, and do not read, copy, print, retransmit, store or act in reliance on the Communication. Any views expressed in the Communication are those of the individual sender only, unless expressly stated to be those of Levanto Financial. Levanto Financial does not guarantee the integrity of the Communication, or that it is free from errors, viruses or interference.</p>

<h1>PERSONAL INFORMATION</h1>

<p>You become a User when you access the Site, pursuant to Levanto’s Terms of Use. Except as required by law or requested by regulatory authorities, Levanto agrees to maintain your non-public information in the strictest confidence.

Levanto restricts access to non-public personal information about Users to certain qualified Levanto employees who require that information in order to maintain and operate the Site. Levanto may ask you for additional personal information, such as your name or picture, in order to provide personalized services to you. Levanto stores, processes, and maintains data related to you in order to provide its products and services through the Site. Levanto’s uses for this data are described below.

When you use the Site, Levanto’s servers automatically record certain information about your use of the Site. Similar to other web services, Levanto records information such as browsing activity, data displayed or clicked on (such as UI elements, ads, and links), and other information (such as browser type, IP address, date and time of access, cookie ID, and referrer URL). Along with cookies, Levanto may also use third-party tracking technology, such as Google Analytics, to record similar information regarding you and your activity on the Site. Levanto is not directed to anyone under the age of 18. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child under the age of 18 has provided us with personally identifiable information without his or her consent, he or she should contact us at info@levantofinancial.com. If we become aware that a child under the age of 18 has provided us with personally identifiable information, we will delete such information from our files.<p>

<h1>USE OF INFORMATION</h1>

<p>Levanto maintains and processes your Levanto account and its contents to provide Levanto’s products and services to you and to improve our services. Levanto’s servers process the information you provide to Levanto for various purposes, including but not limited to formatting and displaying your information, delivering related content, sharing community information, and other purposes relating to the Site.

If you are a Client, Levanto may also process information for directing bill payments, transfers, or account activity, or for reporting your cash flow plan and performance. Levanto may send you information related to Levanto services, or your account if you are a Client. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive marketing communications from us, please follow the “unsubscribe” instructions provided in the communications.<p>

<h1>INFORMATION SHARING AND ONWARD TRANSFER</h1>

<p>We do not sell, rent, or otherwise share your personal information with any third parties except as permitted or required by law, such as when we reasonably believe it is necessary or appropriate to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, frontrunning or scalping, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or violations of our Terms of Use.

You understand and agree that any personal information that you provide through the Site and explicitly agree to share publicly might be made publicly available in Levanto’s discretion, and that other Users may use and reproduce such. We have no control over the use by other Users of the information that you voluntarily disclose to Levanto for this purpose or to the public in general. Levanto maintains physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard Users’ non-public personal information.<p>

<h1>SPECIAL RULES FOR THE USE AND SHARING OF INFORMATION OF CLIENTS</h1>

<p>If you wish to become a Client, we will ask you for certain information, including, but not limited to, your full legal name, contact information, birth date, SSN, citizenship, income, expenses, approximate net worth, and other disclosures that may be necessary. We require such information in order to be able to provide our services to Clients in accordance with the rules of regulatory bodies. You may choose not to provide such information to us, but you will not be able to become a Client.

You may decline to provide personal information to Levanto. Declining to provide personal information may disqualify you for Levanto services and Site features that require certain personal information.<p>

<h1>CHANGES TO THIS POLICY</h1>

<p>This Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent, and we expect most changes will be minor. We will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are substantial, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Privacy Policy changes). Each version of this Privacy Policy will be identified at the top of the page by its effective date.
